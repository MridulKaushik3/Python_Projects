# Python Project Repository

Welcome to my Python Project Repository! In this repository, you will find three distinct projects that I developed to enhance my programming skills: a calculator, a to-do list application, and a password generator. Each project reflects my commitment to coding best practices, user-focused design, and delivering high-quality software solutions.

## Projects Overview

### Calculator
The calculator project is a feature-rich application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations with a user-friendly interface. It includes a sleek design, intuitive user interaction, and robust error handling to ensure accurate calculations and enhance user experience.

**Key Features:**
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Attractive and minimalist user interface
- Input validation and error handling for preventing unexpected behavior
- Responsive layout for various screen sizes

### To-Do List
The to-do list application helps users organize their tasks efficiently. With a clean and simple design, users can easily add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. User data privacy and security were maintained by using local storage and encryption.

**Key Features:**
- Add, edit, and mark tasks as complete
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Data encryption for user privacy
- Local storage to ensure data persistence
- Task prioritization and deadline setting

### Password Generator
The password generator project addresses the need for strong online security. The application generates complex and secure passwords, promoting better digital safety practices. No user data is stored or tracked to maintain trust and security.

**Key Features:**
- Generate strong and customizable passwords
- Options for password length and character sets
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for ease of use
- No data storage or tracking for enhanced security
- Informative tips for creating strong passwords

## Focus on Quality and Ethics

During the development of these projects, I emphasized the importance of coding quality, user data privacy, and secure practices. I ensured that encryption and secure practices were implemented where relevant, and error handling mechanisms were incorporated to provide a smooth user experience.

## User-Centric Design

All projects were developed with a user-centric approach, focusing on creating engaging and intuitive user interfaces. I prioritized simplicity, clarity, and attractive visual elements to engage users effectively.

## Getting Started
